            <h1>About</h1>
            <h4>So what's my deal?</h4>
            <p>
                I'm an incoming graduate student at University of California, Davis in Materials Science and Engineering.
                You might be wondering why I would be taking multiple classes in programming.
                Hmmm... me too.
                Maybe I'll get good enough at it that I'll drop out and never think about engineering again.
                Who knows? Only time will tell!
                I do know that CS50 is pretty fun and I might as well learn how to code.
                After all, quarantine is in effect and now California is on fire...
                Yay!!!
            </p>
            <h4>What else do I do?</h4>
            <p>
                Right now, the answer to that question is a lot sadder than it was last year.
                I pretty much just code and mess around on the internet.
                I eat and work out everyday if that counts, and I do occasionally play piano.
                Back in the day when we could go places, I liked to play basketball as much as possible and travel when I could.
                Trying different restaurants was also fun, but now it's just take out from the same 4 places! Oh yeah!
